# airbnb-investment-dashboard
Project Overview:
This project provides a data-driven approach to help individuals decide where to purchase an Airbnb rental property.

Features;
    Interactive Map: Displays Airbnb listings by zip code with average prices.
    Price Influencing Factors: Highlights key attributes affecting listing prices, such as the number of bedrooms.
    Competition Analysis: Shows how many properties have fewer bedrooms, helping gauge market competition.
    Data Cleaning: Removed unnecessary data points to ensure accuracy.

Dataset: The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and is included in the data folder.
